    you want to run multiple tasks concurrently.
    A program may consits of many tasks that can be run concurrently.
    A thread is the flow of eecution, from beginning to the end of a task.
    Task - adding a list of numbers
    list of size 10_000_000
    Task-1 - sum the elements from 1 to 5_000_000 -> return a number sum1
    Task-2 - sum the elements from 5_000_001 to 10_000_000 -> return a number sum2
    sum1+ sum2 -> final return value
    Create a thread to execute task1 and create a thread to execute task2
    and run them.
    for(Integer element: List)
    sum+=element
    (i)
    Task-1    Task-2
    In case of multiple cores : Task-1 will be executed by say core-1 and Task-2
    will be executed by core-2
    if you have a single core two differents that will be executed on the same
    core concurrently.
     100 millisecond to sum the list in a normal program without thread.
     If you introduce threads it will take 50 milliseconds
   (ii)  Task-1 and Task-2
    Now in a linear program first Task-1 will be finished and then Task-2 will be finished.
    But suppose you don't want to wait for Task-1 to be finished before starting Task-2
